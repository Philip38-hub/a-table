# DeliverNow UX/UI Redesign Project

## 📦 Project Title
**DeliverNow - End-to-End UX/UI Redesign for Food Delivery Platform**

## 📌 Overview
DeliverNow is a food delivery company connecting restaurants, customers, and delivery staff. The current experience has several user pain points:

- **Customers**: Inaccurate delivery estimates, unnecessary cutlery/condiments.
- **Restaurant Owners**: Difficulty managing dine-in and take-away orders efficiently.
- **Delivery Men**: Poorly allocated routes and confusing delivery instructions.
- **Delivery Managers**: Lack of visibility into driver performance and logistics.

This project aims to redesign the full experience for **4 user groups**, by applying the UX/UI design process end-to-end: from user research and problem definition to high-fidelity prototyping and testing.
